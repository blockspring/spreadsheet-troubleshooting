# Check if the Excel plugin is Disabled

There's a chance that parts of Blockspring's Excel plugin were disabled for some reason during the installation process. Hey - it's a Windows computer, an installation process is like the big bang - crazy things happen :).

Instructions:

1) Go to _File > Options > Add-Ins_ in Excel.

2) Select _Manage Disabled Items_

3) If Blockspring is on the disabled list, enable it.
